# User script

## Getting started

User scripts (a.k.a. Greasemonkey scripts) are small computer programs that change the layout of a page, add or remove new functionality and content, or automate actions within modern browsers, such as Chrome.

This approach is called as monkey patching, so the tools in which user scripts run are often named with the word "monkey".

## Install

- Install user script manager, such as [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) or [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag?hl=en).
- Open installation page
- Select "Install from URL"
- Type in the raw url of a `.user.js` file here
- Enable auto update, if it's not default
